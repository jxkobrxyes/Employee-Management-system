**JF 3.2** Can explain the principles and uses of relational and non-relational databases 
- For this project I Implemented JPA to map Java objects to a relational database. JPA handles the serialization and deserialization of the objects, which allows Java objects to be stored in databases.
- Using Spring Data JPA allows me to also create a table within my database which can then perform all the CRUD operations against the database
